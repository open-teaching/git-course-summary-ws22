# Collaborating with git pull & git push
Hello :) this is what we learned about git pull & push 

Info from Cheat Sheet: git push [alias] / [branch] transmits local branch commits to the remote repository branch 
git pull fetches and merges any commits from the tracking remote branch 

First we created a new branch & then edited our txt file ; edited the way we wanted ; then we added the data and commited it 
After that we pushed our txt data to the branch! :) <3 now everybody is happy yay
