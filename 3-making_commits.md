# Making Commits (and what makes a good commit / commit message)



















## What makes a good commit message
it should desrcribe what you have changed compared to the last commit.
It shouldn't be too long.
In your Git you have a list with all the commits you did.
In this List you see the commit message and should understand just with this message what the changes have been.
When there is a mistake you can trace where you changed things according to the mistake.
